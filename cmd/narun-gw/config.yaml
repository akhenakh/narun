# config.yaml example with HTTP and gRPC routes

nats_url: "nats://localhost:4222" # URL of your NATS server
server_addr: ":8080" # Address for the main HTTP gateway to listen on
nkey_seed_file: "" # Optional: Path to NKey seed file for authentication
grpc_addr: ":8081" # Address for the gRPC gateway (optional, remove if no gRPC routes)
metrics_addr: ":9090" # Address for the Prometheus metrics endpoint
request_timeout_seconds: 15 # Max time (seconds) to wait for a NATS reply

# Define routes: map HTTP path/method OR gRPC service to NATS service
routes:
  # --- HTTP Route Example ---
  #- path: "/3eee" # Incoming HTTP request path
  #  methods: ["GET"] # Incoming HTTP request methods
  #  service: "caradioamateur" # Target NATS service name for these HTTP requests

  # --- gRPC Route Example ---
  #- grpc: "hello.v1.Greeter" # Fully qualified gRPC service name
  #  service: "grpc-hello-service" # NATS Micro service name the consumer listens on

  # --- Another HTTP Route ---
  - path: "/hello/"
    methods: ["POST"]
